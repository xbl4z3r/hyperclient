Notes:

> HyperClient isn't a hack!
> This client doesn't give any kind of unfair advantage over other players, it just gives its users mods that can improve FPS and remove Mouse Delay and more!
> Some of these mods may not be allowed on some servers and all of them are marked as **Use at your own risk**.
> We are not responsible if you get banned on any server using this client.
